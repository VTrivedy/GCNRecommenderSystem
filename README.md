# GCNRecommenderSystem
This is the repository for my final final project for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining at Temple University.  This repository contains the data and code used to create a Content-Based Recommender System Based on Graph Convolutional Networks.  This page will be updated as this project branches in new directions.
